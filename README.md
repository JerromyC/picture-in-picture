A simple program that allows you to open the window of your choice in a seperate, smaller, window which will allow for more freedom while working.

Watch along with a coding tutorial without needing to switch back and forth in order to keep up, or something simple like opening a meeting through
the smaller window so you can work as usual and still maintain a high level of contact with team members.
